# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Context

This document provides context for AI assistants (like Claude) to understand and work with the Elephant Network CLI project effectively.

## Project Overview

The Elephant Network CLI is a TypeScript-based command-line tool that:

- Queries the Polygon blockchain for OracleAssigned events
- Decodes IPFS CIDs from blockchain event data
- Downloads assigned files from IPFS gateways
- Validates JSON data against schemas
- Uploads validated data to IPFS via Pinata
- Submits data hashes to smart contracts
- Provides progress tracking and error handling

## Key Technical Details

### Smart Contract Integration

- **Contract Address**: `0x79D5046e34D4A56D357E12636A18da6eaEfe0586` (Polygon mainnet)
- **Event**: `OracleAssigned(bytes propertyCid, address indexed elephant)`
- **CID Format**: The contract stores CIDs with a leading dot (e.g., `.QmXXX...`), which must be stripped

### Important Code Patterns

1. **Event Decoding**: The CID is ABI-encoded as a dynamic string in the event data:

```typescript
const abiCoder = ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder();
const decoded = abiCoder.decode(['string'], bytes)[0];
const cid = decoded.startsWith('.') ? decoded.substring(1) : decoded;
```

2. **Concurrent Downloads**: Uses a queue system with max 3 concurrent downloads
3. **Error Handling**: Specific error messages for RPC, IPFS, and validation failures

### Gas Price Handling

The `submit-to-contract` command includes a `--gas-price` option that accepts a numeric value in Gwei (e.g., `35.5`) or the string `'auto'`.

1.  **CLI Input**: The option is defined in `src/commands/submit-to-contract.ts` with a default of `30`. Input is validated to be a number or `'auto'`.

2.  **Service Layer**: The `gasPrice` value is passed to the `TransactionBatcherService` constructor.

3.  **Transaction Creation**: Inside `TransactionBatcherService.submitBatch`, the `gasPrice` is used to construct the transaction options:
   *   If `gasPrice` is a number, it's converted to Wei and set as the `gasPrice` in the transaction overrides. This forces a legacy-style transaction with a fixed gas price.
   *   If `gasPrice` is `'auto'`, no gas-related options are set in the overrides, allowing `ethers.js` to automatically determine the optimal gas price from the RPC provider (usually using EIP-1559 fee mechanism if available).

```typescript
// src/services/transaction-batcher.service.ts
const txOptions: Overrides = {
   gasLimit:
           estimatedGas + BigInt(Math.floor(Number(estimatedGas) * 0.2)),
};

if (this.gasPrice !== 'auto') {
   txOptions.gasPrice = ethers.parseUnits(
           this.gasPrice.toString(),
           'gwei'
   );
}
//...
const txResponse: TransactionResponse = await this.contract.submitBatch(
        preparedBatch,
        txOptions
);
```

### Testing Information

- **Test Elephant Address**: `0x0e44bfab0f7e1943cF47942221929F898E181505`
- **Test Block with Event**: `71875870`
- **Test CID**: `QmWUnTmuodSYEuHVPgxtrARGra2VpzsusAp4FqT9FWobuU`

## New Split Workflow Commands

The file submission process has been split into three commands for better control:

### validate Command

This command:
1. Validates file structure in the input directory or ZIP file
2. Uses filenames as Schema CIDs to validate JSON data
3. **Validates that schemas are valid data group schemas** (must have exactly two properties: `label` and `relationships`)
4. Handles seed datagroup processing (validates seed files first, skips directories with failed seeds)
5. Writes validation errors to CSV file (default: `submit_errors.csv`)
6. Shows validation summary
7. **Does NOT upload anything to IPFS**
8. **Does NOT calculate CIDs or generate HTML files**
9. **Supports both directory and ZIP file inputs**

### validate-and-upload Command

This command:
1. Validates file structure in the input directory or ZIP file
2. Confirms file assignments to the user
3. Uses filenames as Schema CIDs to validate JSON data
4. **Validates that schemas are valid data group schemas** (must have exactly two properties: `label` and `relationships`)
5. Handles seed datagroup processing (uploads seed files first to get their CIDs)
6. Canonicalizes validated data
7. Uploads canonicalized files to IPFS via Pinata
8. Generates a CSV file with upload results
9. **Supports both directory and ZIP file inputs**

### submit-to-contract Command

This command:
1. Reads the CSV file from validate-and-upload
2. Verifies consensus data differs from submission
3. Checks user hasn't previously submitted same data
4. Submits data hashes to the smart contract in batches
5. In dry-run mode, can optionally generate unsigned transactions CSV for later signing and submission

## Common Tasks for AI Assistants

### Adding New Features

When adding features, follow these patterns:

1. Add types to `src/types/index.ts`
2. Create services in `src/services/`
3. Add command options in `src/index.ts`
4. Update command handler in `src/commands/`

### ZIP File Support

The CLI now supports processing ZIP files containing the expected directory structure:

- Both `validate` and `validate-and-upload` commands accept ZIP files as input
- ZIP files are automatically detected by file extension and magic bytes
- Files are extracted to a temporary directory that's cleaned up after processing
- The same validation and upload logic applies to extracted files
- Temporary directories are properly cleaned up even if errors occur

### Debugging Issues

Common issues to check:

1. **CID Decoding**: Ensure the leading dot is removed
2. **Block Ranges**: Recent blocks work; very old blocks may be pruned
3. **IPFS Gateways**: Some gateways may be slow or unavailable
4. **Log Files**: Check `elephant-cli.log` for detailed debugging information. The log shows blockchain queries, RPC calls, and other internal operations.
5. **Timeout Issues**: The default `DEFAULT_FROM_BLOCK` (72310501) can cause timeouts as it requires querying millions of blocks. In tests, use mock services or skip blockchain queries in dry-run mode.

### Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode
- Async/await for promises
- Error types for better error handling
- Colored console output using chalk
- Progress indicators using ora

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Service Layer**: Separates business logic from CLI concerns
2. **Queue System**: Prevents overwhelming IPFS gateways
3. **Event Decoder**: Handles contract-specific data encoding
4. **Validation**: Input validation before processing
5. **JSON Validator with CID Support**: Advanced schema validation with IPFS integration
6. **ZIP File Support**: Allows users to provide data as ZIP files for easier distribution

## Improvement Opportunities

1. Add caching for blockchain queries
2. Implement retry logic for blockchain queries
3. Add support for multiple elephant addresses
4. Create a config file option
5. Add automated tests

## JSON Validator with CID Support

The `JsonValidatorService` provides advanced JSON schema validation with IPFS integration:

### CID Schema References
Schemas can reference other schemas stored in IPFS using CID:
```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "cid": "QmYjtig7VJQ6XsnUjqqJvj7QaMcCAwtrgNdahSiFofrE7o"
}
```

### CID Pointer Resolution
Data can contain CID pointers that are automatically resolved:
```json
{
  "/": "QmWUnTmuodSYEuHVPgxtrARGra2VpzsusAp4FqT9FWobuU"
}
```

### File Path Linking
Data can reference local files using relative paths:
```json
{
  "/": "./names.json"
}
```
**Important**: File paths are resolved relative to the file containing the reference, not the data directory root. For example:
- If `data/propertyA/file1.json` contains `{"/": "./file2.json"}`, it resolves to `data/propertyA/file2.json`
- If `data/propertyA/file1.json` contains `{"/": "../propertyB/file3.json"}`, it resolves to `data/propertyB/file3.json`

### Features
1. **Automatic CID Resolution**: When validating data containing `{"/": <cid>}`, the validator:
   - Fetches the content from IPFS
   - Replaces the pointer with actual content
   - Validates against the schema

2. **Schema CID References**: Schemas with `{"type": "string", "cid": <cid>}`:
   - Fetch the schema from IPFS
   - Use it for validation
   - Cache for performance

3. **Recursive Resolution**: Works with nested structures and arrays

4. **CID Format Validation**: Validates CID strings using multiformats library

5. **File Path Resolution**: Relative file paths in IPLD links are resolved relative to the containing file's directory, not the data directory root

6. **Enhanced Error Messages**: Provides detailed, user-friendly error messages for validation failures:
   - Format errors include specific format requirements (e.g., "must be a valid ISO date in YYYY-MM-DD format")
   - Custom format errors explain the expected format (e.g., "must be a positive number with at most 2 decimal places")
   - Validation errors specify the issue clearly (e.g., "missing required property 'name'")

### Example Flow
```typescript
// Schema references another schema via CID
const schema = {
  type: "string",
  cid: "QmSchemaCID..."
};

// Data is a CID pointer
const data = {
  "/": "QmDataCID..."
};

// Both are fetched from IPFS and validated
const result = await validator.validate(data, schema);
```

## Seed Datagroup Feature

The validate-and-upload command supports a special "seed datagroup" workflow:

### Directory Structure
Two types of directories are supported:
1. **Standard CID directories**: Directory name is a valid IPFS CID
2. **Seed datagroup directories**: Directory name can be anything, but must contain a file named `bafkreigpfi4pqur43wj3x2dwm43hnbtrxabgwsi3hobzbtqrs3iytohevu.json`

### Processing Workflow
1. **Phase 1**: All seed files (`bafkreigpfi4pqur43wj3x2dwm43hnbtrxabgwsi3hobzbtqrs3iytohevu.json`) are processed first
2. **Phase 2**: All other files are processed, with files in seed datagroup directories using the uploaded seed CID as their `propertyCid`

### Implementation Details
- Files are scanned and marked with `SEED_PENDING:${dirName}` for seed datagroup directories
- Seed files are uploaded first and their CIDs are stored in a map
- Non-seed files in seed datagroup directories get their `propertyCid` updated to the uploaded seed CID
- All files (seed and non-seed) from the same directory share the same `propertyCid` in the final CSV output

### File Scanner Service Changes
- `validateStructure()`: Accepts directories with seed files even if directory name isn't a CID
- `scanDirectory()`: Marks seed datagroup files with special `SEED_PENDING:` prefix
- `getAllDataGroupCids()`: Includes the hardcoded seed datagroup schema CID when found

## Unsigned Transactions Feature

The `submit-to-contract` command supports generating unsigned transactions for later signing and submission when used with `--dry-run` and `--unsigned-transactions-json` options.

### Use Cases
- **Cold wallet signing**: Generate transactions on an online machine, transfer to offline machine for signing
- **Multi-signature workflows**: Prepare transactions for multiple signers
- **Batch preparation**: Generate all transactions at once for later submission
- **Gas price optimization**: Generate transactions and submit when gas prices are favorable

### JSON Format
The unsigned transactions JSON contains an array of EIP-1474 compliant transaction objects with the following fields:
- `from`: Sender address
- `to`: Contract address
- `gas`: Estimated gas limit with 20% buffer (hex-encoded)
- `value`: Transaction value (always '0x0' for these calls)
- `data`: Encoded function call data (hex-encoded)
- `nonce`: Transaction nonce (hex-encoded)
- `type`: Transaction type ('0x0' for legacy, '0x2' for EIP-1559)
- `gasPrice`: Gas price in Wei (legacy transactions, hex-encoded)
- `maxFeePerGas`: Maximum fee per gas in Wei (EIP-1559 transactions, hex-encoded)
- `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: Priority fee per gas in Wei (EIP-1559 transactions, hex-encoded)

### Transaction Types
- **Legacy transactions** (type 0): Used when `--gas-price` is specified as a number
- **EIP-1559 transactions** (type 2): Used when `--gas-price auto` is specified

### Security Notes
- Unsigned transactions contain no private information
- Generated nonces are sequential starting from the current account nonce
- Gas estimates are fetched from the RPC provider when possible
- All CIDs are properly converted to hashes for contract calls

## Security Considerations

- Validates all user inputs (addresses, URLs)
- No private keys or sensitive data handled
- Downloads files only from IPFS (content-addressed)
- Uses HTTPS for all external connections
- ZIP files are extracted to temporary directories that are automatically cleaned up
- ZIP extraction validates file structure before processing
