# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Context

This document provides context for AI assistants (like Claude) to understand and work with the Elephant Network CLI project effectively.

## Project Overview

The Elephant Network CLI is a TypeScript-based command-line tool that:

- Queries the Polygon blockchain for OracleAssigned events
- Decodes IPFS CIDs from blockchain event data
- Downloads assigned files from IPFS gateways
- Validates JSON data against schemas
- Uploads validated data to IPFS via Pinata
- Submits data hashes to smart contracts
- Provides progress tracking and error handling

## Key Technical Details

### Smart Contract Integration

- **Contract Address**: `0x79D5046e34D4A56D357E12636A18da6eaEfe0586` (Polygon mainnet)
- **Event**: `OracleAssigned(bytes propertyCid, address indexed elephant)`
- **CID Format**: The contract stores CIDs with a leading dot (e.g., `.QmXXX...`), which must be stripped

### Important Code Patterns

1. **Event Decoding**: The CID is ABI-encoded as a dynamic string in the event data:

```typescript
const abiCoder = ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder();
const decoded = abiCoder.decode(['string'], bytes)[0];
const cid = decoded.startsWith('.') ? decoded.substring(1) : decoded;
```

2. **Concurrent Downloads**: Uses a queue system with max 3 concurrent downloads
3. **Error Handling**: Specific error messages for RPC, IPFS, and validation failures

### Gas Price Handling

The `submit-to-contract` command includes a `--gas-price` option that accepts a numeric value in Gwei (e.g., `35.5`) or the string `'auto'`.

1.  **CLI Input**: The option is defined in `src/commands/submit-to-contract.ts` with a default of `30`. Input is validated to be a number or `'auto'`.

2.  **Service Layer**: The `gasPrice` value is passed to the `TransactionBatcherService` constructor.

3.  **Transaction Creation**: Inside `TransactionBatcherService.submitBatch`, the `gasPrice` is used to construct the transaction options:
   *   If `gasPrice` is a number, it's converted to Wei and set as the `gasPrice` in the transaction overrides. This forces a legacy-style transaction with a fixed gas price.
   *   If `gasPrice` is `'auto'`, no gas-related options are set in the overrides, allowing `ethers.js` to automatically determine the optimal gas price from the RPC provider (usually using EIP-1559 fee mechanism if available).

```typescript
// src/services/transaction-batcher.service.ts
const txOptions: Overrides = {
  gasLimit: 
    estimatedGas + BigInt(Math.floor(Number(estimatedGas) * 0.2)),
};

if (this.gasPrice !== 'auto') {
  txOptions.gasPrice = ethers.parseUnits(
    this.gasPrice.toString(),
      'gwei'
   );
}
//...
const txResponse: TransactionResponse = await this.contract.submitBatch(
  preparedBatch, 
  txOptions
);
```

### Testing Information

- **Test Elephant Address**: `0x0e44bfab0f7e1943cF47942221929F898E181505`
- **Test Block with Event**: `71875870`
- **Test CID**: `QmWUnTmuodSYEuHVPgxtrARGra2VpzsusAp4FqT9FWobuU`

## New Split Workflow Commands

The file submission process has been split into three commands for better control:

### validate Command

This command:
1. **Requires ZIP file input** containing single property data
2. **Expects property directory contents directly in ZIP** (no wrapper directory)
3. Extracts ZIP to temporary directory for processing
4. Validates file structure
5. **Identifies datagroup files by structure** (must have exactly two properties: `label` and `relationships`)
6. **Uses the `label` value to look up the datagroup CID** from Elephant Network's schema manifest
7. Uses datagroup CIDs to validate JSON data against schemas
8. **Validates that schemas are valid data group schemas** (must have exactly two properties: `label` and `relationships`)
9. Handles seed datagroup processing (validates seed files first, skips directories with failed seeds)
10. Writes validation errors to CSV file (default: `submit_errors.csv`)
11. Shows validation summary
12. **Does NOT upload anything to IPFS**
13. **Does NOT calculate CIDs or generate HTML files**
14. **Single Property Only**: Processes data for one property at a time

### validate-and-upload Command

This command:
1. Validates file structure in the input directory
2. Confirms file assignments to the user
3. **For files with CID names**: Uses filenames as Schema CIDs to validate JSON data
4. **For files with any names**: Identifies datagroup files by structure (must have exactly two properties: `label` and `relationships`), then uses the label to look up the datagroup CID from the schema manifest
5. **Validates that schemas are valid data group schemas** (must have exactly two properties: `label` and `relationships`)
6. Handles seed datagroup processing (uploads seed files first to get their CIDs)
7. Canonicalizes validated data
8. Uploads canonicalized files to IPFS via Pinata
9. Generates a CSV file with upload results

### submit-to-contract Command

This command:
1. Reads the CSV file from validate-and-upload
2. Verifies consensus data differs from submission
3. Checks user hasn't previously submitted same data
4. Submits data hashes to the smart contract in batches
5. In dry-run mode, can optionally generate unsigned transactions CSV for later signing and submission

### hash Command

This command:
1. **Requires ZIP file input** containing single property data
2. **Expects property directory contents directly in ZIP** (no wrapper directory)
3. Extracts ZIP to temporary directory for processing
4. **Identifies datagroup files by structure** (must have exactly two properties: `label` and `relationships`)
5. **Uses the `label` value to look up the datagroup CID** from Elephant Network's schema manifest
6. Validates file structure and JSON data against schemas
7. **Validates that schemas are valid data group schemas** (must have exactly two properties: `label` and `relationships`)
8. Handles seed datagroup processing (processes seed files first)
9. **Determines property CID** using priority: `--property-cid` option > calculated Seed CID > error
10. **Calculates CIDs for all files without uploading to IPFS**
11. **Replaces all file path links with calculated CIDs**
12. **Canonicalizes all data**
13. **Generates CSV file with hash results** (propertyCid, dataGroupCid, dataCid, filePath, uploadedAt) - fully compatible with submit-to-contract
14. **Outputs transformed data as a ZIP archive with CID-based filenames**

Key features:
- **Single Property Only**: Processes data for one property at a time
- **ZIP Input Required**: Only accepts ZIP archives, not directories
- **CSV Output**: Generates submission-ready CSV compatible with `submit-to-contract`
- **CID Calculation**: Uses the same algorithm as `validate-and-upload --dry-run`
- **Link Replacement**: Converts `{"/": "./file.json"}` references to `{"/": "calculated-cid"}`
- **IPLD Support**: Handles IPLD links and ipfs_url fields correctly
- **Image Processing**: Calculates appropriate CIDs for image files with ipfs_uri format
- **Seed Datagroup**: Processes seed files first and uses their CIDs for property identification
- **Output Structure**: Creates ZIP with single `property-cid/file-cid.json` structure (no 'data' wrapper)
- **Property CID Options**: Supports `--property-cid` flag to override automatic detection

### upload Command

This command:
1. **Takes ZIP output from hash command** containing property directories with CID-named files
2. **Extracts ZIP to temporary directory** for processing
3. **Detects property directory structure** (single or multiple properties)
4. **Uploads each property directory to IPFS via Pinata** in a single API request
5. **Analyzes datagroup files** to generate proper CSV output
6. **Generates CSV compatible with submit-to-contract** with actual upload timestamps

Key features:
- **Optimized for Upload**: No validation or CID calculation - just pure upload functionality
- **Batch Upload**: Uploads entire directories as single IPFS objects
- **Smart Structure Detection**: Handles both single property (from hash command) and multiple property directories
- **Datagroup Analysis**: Identifies datagroup root files by structure (label + relationships keys)
- **Schema Manifest Integration**: Uses schema manifest to map labels to datagroup CIDs
- **CSV Generation**: Creates submission-ready CSV with proper format (propertyCid, dataGroupCid, dataCid, filePath, uploadedAt)
- **Environment Variable Support**: Can use PINATA_JWT from environment if not provided via CLI
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators during upload
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling with proper cleanup

Technical implementation:
- Uses `PinataDirectoryUploadService` for optimized directory uploads
- Employs `datagroup-analyzer` utility to identify and analyze datagroup files
- Integrates with `SchemaManifestService` for label-to-CID mapping
- Preserves directory structure when uploading to IPFS

### fetch-data Command

This command:
1. Downloads data from IPFS starting from a root CID
2. Fetches schema manifest from Elephant Network API to get datagroup CIDs
3. Recursively follows all CID references in the data
4. Replaces CID references with local file paths
5. Saves all data as a ZIP file
6. Names root datagroup files using their schema CID from manifest

Key features:
- **Automatic CID Resolution**: Handles `{"/": "CID"}` references automatically
- **Path Replacement**: Converts CID pointers to relative file paths
- **Rate Limiting**: Handles IPFS gateway rate limits with exponential backoff
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows detailed download progress
- **Schema Manifest Integration**: Fetches datagroup CIDs from `https://lexicon.elephant.xyz/json-schemas/schema-manifest.json`
- **Smart Filename Mapping**: Uses datagroup schema CIDs for root files based on their label
- **ZIP Output**: All fetched data is packaged into a ZIP file for easy distribution

## Common Tasks for AI Assistants

### Adding New Features

When adding features, follow these patterns:

1. Add types to `src/types/index.ts`
2. Create services in `src/services/`
3. Add command options in `src/index.ts`
4. Update command handler in `src/commands/`

### ZIP File Support

The CLI supports processing ZIP files with different structures:

### Single Property Commands (validate, hash)
- **Require** ZIP files as input
- **Expect property directory contents directly in ZIP** (no wrapper directory)
- Example structure:
  ```
  single-property.zip:
    ├── bafkreif7ywbjxu3s6jfi6ginvmsufeux3cd5eujuivg2y7tmqt2qk4rsoe.json
    ├── property_seed.json
    └── other_schema_cid.json
  ```

### Multiple Property Commands (validate-and-upload)
- Accept both directories and ZIP files
- Support multiple property directories
- Example structure:
  ```
  multi-property.zip:
    ├── property1/
    │   └── schema_cid.json
    └── property2/
        └── schema_cid.json
  ```

### General ZIP Handling
- ZIP files are automatically detected by file extension and magic bytes
- Files are extracted to a temporary directory that's cleaned up after processing
- The same validation and upload logic applies to extracted files
- Temporary directories are properly cleaned up even if errors occur

### Data Fetching Command

The `fetch-data` command supports two modes:

1. **CID Mode**: Fetches data tree from an IPFS CID
   - Downloads the root CID and recursively follows all CID references
   - Replaces CID references with local file paths
   - Uses schema manifest for proper file naming
   - Creates ZIP file with directory structure: `<CID>/` containing all fetched data

2. **Transaction Hash Mode**: Extracts and fetches data from blockchain transactions
   - Fetches transaction data from blockchain using RPC
   - Decodes `submitBatchData` calls to extract property, data group, and data hashes
   - Converts hashes to CIDs using `CidHexConverterService.hexToCid` (raw codec, base32 encoding)
   - Creates ZIP file with directory structure: `propertyCID/` directories for each property
   - Downloads and fetches data for each item in the transaction

Key implementation details:
- Transaction decoding uses ethers.js Interface to parse ABI-encoded data
- Hash-to-CID conversion uses `CidHexConverterService` which creates CID v1 with raw codec (0x55)
- Each property in a transaction gets its own directory
- DataGroup files are saved directly in the property directory with their CID as filename
- Referenced files (e.g., property_seed) are named based on their field names in the data structure

File naming convention:
- Root dataGroup file: `<dataGroupCid>.json`
- Direct CID references: `<fieldName>.json` (e.g., `property_seed.json`)
- Nested references: `<fieldName>_<subKey>.json` (e.g., `property_seed_from.json`, `property_seed_to.json`)

### Debugging Issues

Common issues to check:

1. **CID Decoding**: Ensure the leading dot is removed
2. **Block Ranges**: Recent blocks work; very old blocks may be pruned
3. **IPFS Gateways**: Some gateways may be slow or unavailable
4. **Log Files**: Check `elephant-cli.log` for detailed debugging information. The log shows blockchain queries, RPC calls, and other internal operations.
5. **Timeout Issues**: The default `DEFAULT_FROM_BLOCK` (72310501) can cause timeouts as it requires querying millions of blocks. In tests, use mock services or skip blockchain queries in dry-run mode.

### Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode
- Async/await for promises
- Error types for better error handling
- Colored console output using chalk
- Progress indicators using ora

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Service Layer**: Separates business logic from CLI concerns
2. **Queue System**: Prevents overwhelming IPFS gateways
3. **Event Decoder**: Handles contract-specific data encoding
4. **Validation**: Input validation before processing
5. **JSON Validator with CID Support**: Advanced schema validation with IPFS integration
6. **ZIP File Support**: Allows users to provide data as ZIP files for easier distribution
7. **Schema Manifest Service**: Centralized service for fetching and managing datagroup schema mappings from Elephant Network
8. **Flexible File Recognition**: Files are identified as datagroups by their structure (label + relationships) rather than requiring CID filenames

## Improvement Opportunities

1. Add caching for blockchain queries
2. Implement retry logic for blockchain queries
3. Add support for multiple elephant addresses
4. Create a config file option
5. Add automated tests

## Known Limitations

1. No resume capability for interrupted downloads
2. No caching of blockchain queries
3. Single elephant address at a time
4. No export formats (only console output)

## JSON Validator with CID Support

The `JsonValidatorService` provides advanced JSON schema validation with IPFS integration:

### CID Schema References
Schemas can reference other schemas stored in IPFS using CID:
```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "cid": "QmYjtig7VJQ6XsnUjqqJvj7QaMcCAwtrgNdahSiFofrE7o"
}
```

### CID Pointer Resolution
Data can contain CID pointers that are automatically resolved:
```json
{
  "/": "QmWUnTmuodSYEuHVPgxtrARGra2VpzsusAp4FqT9FWobuU"
}
```

### File Path Linking
Data can reference local files using relative paths:
```json
{
  "/": "./names.json"
}
```
**Important**: File paths are resolved relative to the file containing the reference, not the data directory root. For example:
- If `data/propertyA/file1.json` contains `{"/": "./file2.json"}`, it resolves to `data/propertyA/file2.json`
- If `data/propertyA/file1.json` contains `{"/": "../propertyB/file3.json"}`, it resolves to `data/propertyB/file3.json`

### Features
1. **Automatic CID Resolution**: When validating data containing `{"/": <cid>}`, the validator:
   - Fetches the content from IPFS
   - Replaces the pointer with actual content
   - Validates against the schema

2. **Schema CID References**: Schemas with `{"type": "string", "cid": <cid>}`:
   - Fetch the schema from IPFS
   - Use it for validation
   - Cache for performance

3. **Recursive Resolution**: Works with nested structures and arrays

4. **CID Format Validation**: Validates CID strings using multiformats library

5. **File Path Resolution**: Relative file paths in IPLD links are resolved relative to the containing file's directory, not the data directory root

6. **Enhanced Error Messages**: Provides detailed, user-friendly error messages for validation failures:
   - Format errors include specific format requirements (e.g., "must be a valid ISO date in YYYY-MM-DD format")
   - Custom format errors explain the expected format (e.g., "must be a positive number with at most 2 decimal places")
   - Validation errors specify the issue clearly (e.g., "missing required property 'name'")

### Example Flow
```typescript
// Schema references another schema via CID
const schema = {
  type: "string",
  cid: "QmSchemaCID..."
};

// Data is a CID pointer
const data = {
  "/": "QmDataCID..."
};

// Both are fetched from IPFS and validated
const result = await validator.validate(data, schema);
```

## Datagroup File Recognition

### Flexible File Naming
As of the latest version, datagroup files are recognized by their structure rather than their filename:
- Files must have exactly two properties: `label` and `relationships`
- The `label` value is matched against the Elephant Network schema manifest to determine the datagroup CID
- Files can have any name - the system automatically identifies them as datagroups based on their content

### Schema Manifest Integration
The system fetches the schema manifest from `https://lexicon.elephant.xyz/json-schemas/schema-manifest.json` which contains mappings of datagroup labels to their CIDs. This allows flexible file naming while maintaining proper schema validation.

## Seed Datagroup Feature

The validate-and-upload, validate, and hash commands support a special "seed datagroup" workflow:

### Directory Structure
Two types of directories are supported:
1. **Standard CID directories**: Directory name is a valid IPFS CID
2. **Seed datagroup directories**: Directory name can be anything, files are identified by their structure and label

### Processing Workflow
1. **Phase 1**: All seed files (`bafkreigpfi4pqur43wj3x2dwm43hnbtrxabgwsi3hobzbtqrs3iytohevu.json`) are processed first
2. **Phase 2**: All other files are processed, with files in seed datagroup directories using the uploaded seed CID as their `propertyCid`

### Implementation Details
- Files are scanned and marked with `SEED_PENDING:${dirName}` for seed datagroup directories
- Seed files are uploaded first and their CIDs are stored in a map
- Non-seed files in seed datagroup directories get their `propertyCid` updated to the uploaded seed CID
- All files (seed and non-seed) from the same directory share the same `propertyCid` in the final CSV output

### File Scanner Service Changes
- `validateStructure()`: Accepts directories with seed files even if directory name isn't a CID
- `scanDirectory()`: Marks seed datagroup files with special `SEED_PENDING:` prefix
- `getAllDataGroupCids()`: Includes the hardcoded seed datagroup schema CID when found

## Unsigned Transactions Feature

The `submit-to-contract` command supports generating unsigned transactions for later signing and submission when used with `--dry-run` and `--unsigned-transactions-json` options.

### Use Cases
- **Cold wallet signing**: Generate transactions on an online machine, transfer to offline machine for signing
- **Multi-signature workflows**: Prepare transactions for multiple signers
- **Batch preparation**: Generate all transactions at once for later submission
- **Gas price optimization**: Generate transactions and submit when gas prices are favorable

### JSON Format
The unsigned transactions JSON contains an array of EIP-1474 compliant transaction objects with the following fields:
- `from`: Sender address
- `to`: Contract address
- `gas`: Estimated gas limit with 20% buffer (hex-encoded)
- `value`: Transaction value (always '0x0' for these calls)
- `data`: Encoded function call data (hex-encoded)
- `nonce`: Transaction nonce (hex-encoded)
- `type`: Transaction type ('0x0' for legacy, '0x2' for EIP-1559)
- `gasPrice`: Gas price in Wei (legacy transactions, hex-encoded)
- `maxFeePerGas`: Maximum fee per gas in Wei (EIP-1559 transactions, hex-encoded)
- `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: Priority fee per gas in Wei (EIP-1559 transactions, hex-encoded)

### Transaction Types
- **Legacy transactions** (type 0): Used when `--gas-price` is specified as a number
- **EIP-1559 transactions** (type 2): Used when `--gas-price auto` is specified

### Security Notes
- Unsigned transactions contain no private information
- Generated nonces are sequential starting from the current account nonce
- Gas estimates are fetched from the RPC provider when possible
- All CIDs are properly converted to hashes for contract calls

## Security Considerations

- Validates all user inputs (addresses, URLs)
- No private keys or sensitive data handled
- Downloads files only from IPFS (content-addressed)
- Uses HTTPS for all external connections
- ZIP files are extracted to temporary directories that are automatically cleaned up
- ZIP extraction validates file structure before processing
