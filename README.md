# Elephant Network CLI

A command-line tool for Elephant Network oracles to manage their data on the Polygon blockchain. This tool helps you validate and submit data to the decentralized Elephant Network.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally (recommended)
npm install -g @elephant-xyz/cli

# Or use without installation
npx @elephant-xyz/cli --help
```

### Requirements

- Node.js 20.0 or higher
- Internet connection for blockchain and IPFS access
- Polygon mainnet access (via RPC)

## What You Can Do

The Elephant Network CLI provides two main workflows:

1. **âœ… Validate & Upload** - Process and upload your data files  
2. **ðŸ”— Submit to Blockchain** - Register your submissions on-chain

## Workflow 1: Preparing and Uploading Data

### Step 1: Organize Your Data

Structure your data directory like this:
```
your-data/
â”œâ”€â”€ root_cid1/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ schema_cid.json     # Your data file
â”œâ”€â”€ root_cid2/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ schema_cid.json     # Your data file
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

**Important:** 
- Directory names must be root CIDs (a.k.a. seed CIDs) 
- File names must be schema CIDs
- Files must contain valid JSON data

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials

You'll need:
- **Private Key**: Your oracle wallet private key
- **Pinata JWT**: Token for IPFS uploads (get from [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud))

Set up environment variables (recommended):
```bash
# Create a .env file in your project directory
echo "ELEPHANT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here" >> .env
echo "PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_here" >> .env
```

### Step 3: Validate and Upload (Dry Run First)

Always test first with `--dry-run`:

```bash
# Test without uploading
elephant-cli validate-and-upload ./your-data --dry-run --output-csv test-results.csv
```

**What this does:**
- Validates your JSON files against the required schemas
- Converts file path references to IPFS CIDs
- Shows what would be uploaded (without actually uploading)
- Creates a CSV report

**IPLD Links Support:**
Your JSON data can reference other files using IPLD links:

```json
{
  "title": "Main Document",
  "metadata": {
    "/": "./metadata.json"
  },
  "license": {
    "/": "../shared/license.json"  
  }
}
```

The CLI automatically:
- Uploads referenced files to IPFS
- Converts file paths to IPFS CIDs
- Creates proper IPLD-linked data structures

### Step 4: Upload for Real

If dry run succeeds, upload your data:

```bash
elephant-cli validate-and-upload ./your-data --output-csv upload-results.csv
```

**What this does:**
- Validates all your data files
- Uploads valid files to IPFS via Pinata
- Creates a CSV file with upload results (needed for next step)

## Workflow 2: Submitting to Blockchain

### Step 1: Review Upload Results

Check the CSV file from the previous step (`upload-results.csv`). It contains:
- Root CIDs (a.k.a. seed CIDs)
- Data group CIDs  
- Your uploaded data CIDs
- File paths and timestamps

### Step 2: Submit to Contract (Dry Run First)

Test the blockchain submission:

```bash
elephant-cli submit-to-contract upload-results.csv --dry-run
```

**What this does:**
- Verifies your data differs from existing consensus
- Checks you haven't already submitted the same data
- Shows what transactions would be sent (without sending them)

### Step 3: Submit for Real

If dry run succeeds, submit to the blockchain:

```bash
elephant-cli submit-to-contract upload-results.csv --gas-price 30
```

**What this does:**
- Submits your data hashes to the Elephant Network smart contract
- Groups submissions into batches for efficiency
- Provides transaction confirmations

## Advanced Features

### Custom Configuration

```bash
# Control upload concurrency
elephant-cli validate-and-upload ./data --max-concurrent-uploads 5

# Custom gas price for submissions
elephant-cli submit-to-contract results.csv --gas-price 50
# Or let the network decide
elephant-cli submit-to-contract results.csv --gas-price auto
```



## Common Command Options


### Validate and Upload Options  
- `--pinata-jwt <token>` - Pinata API token (or use PINATA_JWT env var)
- `--output-csv <file>` - Results file name (default: upload-results.csv)
- `--max-concurrent-uploads <num>` - Control upload speed
- `--dry-run` - Test without uploading

### Submit to Contract Options
- `--private-key <key>` - Wallet private key (or use ELEPHANT_PRIVATE_KEY env var)
- `--gas-price <value>` - Gas price in Gwei or 'auto' (default: 30)
- `--transaction-batch-size <num>` - Items per transaction (default: 200)
- `--dry-run` - Test without submitting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid oracle address"**
- Use a valid Ethereum address format: `0x1234...` (42 characters)

**"No data found"**
- Check your oracle address is correct
- Verify you have data in the specified period

**"Validation failed"**
- Check your JSON files match the required schema
- Ensure file paths exist for IPLD links
- Review error details in the generated error CSV

**"Upload failed"**
- Verify your Pinata JWT token is valid
- Check your internet connection
- Try reducing `--max-concurrent-uploads`

**"Transaction failed"**
- Ensure your private key has sufficient MATIC for gas
- Try increasing `--gas-price`
- Check you haven't already submitted the same data
